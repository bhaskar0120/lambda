# Lambda

Exploring basic lambda calculus in Python. In this repo I have used the lambda function built into python to
get a more intiutive feel of lambda calculus and functional programming.


### Some resources for lambda calculus 
- Introduction to Lambda Calculus by Barendregt and Barandsen
- [BLOG POST : The Lambda Calculus for Absolute Dummies (like myself)](http://palmstroem.blogspot.com/2012/05/lambda-calculus-for-absolute-dummies.html)
